This document presents a recommended format for communicating results of
the evaluation of website accessibility according to the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. A consistent and comprehensive
evaluation report format can help ensure effective evaluations as well
as accurate comparisons of accessibility levels over time and between
different websites.

Note that you can also use the [evaluation report tool
generator](https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/report-tool/#/), an interactive
tool that leads you through a manual accessibility evaluation, to create
an accessibility report based on the [WCAG Evaluation
Methodology](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-EM/).

Suggested items in the report format may vary depending the context.
Words in brackets \[...\] are intended to be filled in with information
from the actual review. Related documents describing the evaluation
method, and organization of review teams, are listed in the References
section below.

If you are new to web accessibility you may want to start with [Easy
Checks - A First Review of Web
Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/preliminary.html) to learn
the first steps of evaluating the accessibility of a web page.

### 1. Executive Summary {#summary}

This report describes the conformance of the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ website
with [W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](#wcag20).
The review process is described in Section 5 below and is based on the
W3C's Conformance Evaluation method as described in [Evaluating Web
Sites for Accessibility](#eval).

Based on this evaluation, the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ website \[meets/does
not meet/is close to meeting\] WCAG 2.0, Conformance Level AA. Detailed
review results are available in Section 6 below. Resources for follow-up
study are listed in Section 7 below. Feedback on this evaluation is
welcome.

### 2. Background about Evaluation {#background}

Conformance evaluation of Web accessibility requires a combination of
[semi-automated evaluation tools](#tools) and manual evaluation by an
experienced reviewer. The evaluation results in this report are based on
evaluation conducted on the following date(s): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. The Web
site may have changed since that time. Additional information on the
evaluation process is available in [Evaluating websites for
Accessibility](#eval).
